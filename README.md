# Classic Arcade Game
___

This is a version of the classic arcade game, _Frogger_.  The player begins at the bottom of the grid, and must make it across the three "enemy" rows, in which there are bugs crossing at various speeds.  The player may move in any direction (front, back, left, right) by using the keyboard.  Once they reach the water, a dialog popup appears, congratulating the player for winning the game, and prompting them to play again.
